# Dotfiles

This repository contains my personal dotfiles for configuring Linux systems. Dotfiles are configuration files that are typically hidden and reside in the user's home directory.

## Installation

To use these dotfiles, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository
2. Navigate to the dotfiles directory: `cd dotfiles`
3. Link your desired application dotfile with: `ln -s ~/.dotfiles/zsh/.zshrc ~/.zshrc`
4. Restart your terminal or shell for the changes to take effect.

## Usage

Each application config has it's own usability and installation process.

Feel free to explore and modify these dotfiles to suit your preferences.
